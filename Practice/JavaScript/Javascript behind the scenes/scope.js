/*
Scope Concepts
Scoping: How our program's variables are organized and accessed. "Where do variables live?" "Where can we access certain variables and where not?"

Lexical scoping: Scoping is controlled by placements of functions and blocks in the code.

Scope: Space or environment in which certain variables is declared (variable environment in case of functions). There is global scope, function scope and block scope.

Scope of a variable: Region of our code where certain variable can be accessed.
